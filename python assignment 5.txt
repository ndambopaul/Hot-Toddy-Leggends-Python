Assignment on Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries

### Objective
The objective of this assignment is to understand and practice the basic concepts of Python collections: lists, tuples, sets, and dictionaries.


### Part 1: Lists
1. Create a list of your five favorite fruits and:
   - Print the entire list.
   - Add a new fruit to the list.
   - Remove the second fruit from the list.
   - Sort the list in alphabetical order.
   - Print the length of the list.

2. Using list comprehension(This is optional, to solve it, research on something called list comprehension):
   - Create a list of squares for numbers 1 to 10.
   - Print the newly created list.



### Part 2: Tuples
1. Create a tuple containing the names of five cities you would like to visit and:
   - Print the entire tuple.
   - Attempt to change one of the cities in the tuple (observe what happens and add a comment explaining the behavior).
   - Access and print the last city in the tuple using negative indexing.

2. Unpack the tuple into individual variables and print each variable.


### Part 3: Sets
1. Create a set of your favorite book genres and:
   - Print the entire set.
   - Add a new genre to the set.
   - Remove an existing genre from the set.
   - Attempt to add a duplicate genre and explain what happens (using a comment).

2. Demonstrate the use of set operations:
   - Create another set with genres you want to explore.
   - Find and print the union and intersection of the two sets.



### Part 4: Dictionaries
1. Create a dictionary that holds information about you, with keys like "name", "age", "city", and "hobbies". Then:
   - Print the entire dictionary.
   - Add a new key-value pair for "favorite_color".
   - Update your age to be one year older.
   - Remove the "city" key from the dictionary.
   - Use a loop to print each key-value pair in the dictionary.

2. Create a dictionary that maps numbers 1 to 5 to their corresponding words (e.g., {1: "one", 2: "two", ...}).
   - Access and print the word corresponding to the number 3.
   - Use a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that maps numbers 1 to 10 to their squares.
